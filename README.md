Function Classification with Neural Networks: Give me a collection of 2D points, and I am going to tell you

- what general class of function you are looking at  -- linear, polynomial, sinusoidal, exponential..
- what degree fits best
- any other fitting constants

and all by using a collection of artificial neurons that were trained on a collection of those functions.

Dependencies
------------

- a Java runtime environment >= 1.6
- swing for graphical output

Documentation
-------------

A paper on the subject can be found in doc/main.pdf

Have fun!
