2D Function Fitting with Artificial Intelligence

Pascal S. P. Steger

I present an application of artificial intelligence to function
classification and regression starting from a two-dimensional dataset
of measurements with errors. Three sets of methods are considered:
Neural networks, evolutionary optimization and clustering in Fourier space.

The overall procedure will be shown; starting with the preparation of
the data, the modular parts of the program are explained, sample runs and
runtime characteristics are sketched, limitations and not recognized
functions are shown. A comparison concludes the work.

The focus lies on adaptation of known algorithms to this specific
problem; we restrict ourselves to smooth functions y=f(x).
